    "architecture": "# System Architecture\n\n## Component Design\n\n### System Components\n\n1. **Trading Strategy Development Module:** This module is responsible for developing and refining trading strategies. It includes features for calculating the expected value of a strategy, testing a strategy through back-testing or forward-testing, and refining a strategy based on results.\n\n2. **Market Analysis Module:** This module is responsible for analyzing market data to identify trends and correlations. It includes features for observing market patterns and reverse engineering past market moves.\n\n3. **Integration Module:** This module is responsible for integrating with external platforms, scanners, and documentation tools. It includes features for connecting to APIs and handling data exchange.\n\n4. **Data Management Module:** This module is responsible for managing the data used by the application, including the strategies and market data. It includes features for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.\n\n### Component Interactions\n\nThe Trading Strategy Development Module interacts with the Market Analysis Module to use the market data and analysis results in developing and refining strategies. It also interacts with the Data Management Module to store and retrieve strategies and their results.\n\nThe Market Analysis Module interacts with the Data Management Module to store and retrieve market data and analysis results.\n\nThe Integration Module interacts with the Trading Strategy Development Module and the Market Analysis Module to provide external data and services. It also interacts with the Data Management Module to store and retrieve integration data.\n\n### Data Flow\n\nThe data flows from the Integration Module to the Market Analysis Module and the Trading Strategy Development Module, where it is processed and used to develop and refine strategies. The processed data then flows to the Data Management Module for storage.\n\n### Integration Patterns\n\nThe Integration Module uses the Adapter pattern to provide a consistent interface for integrating with different external platforms, scanners, and documentation tools. It also uses the Publisher-Subscriber pattern to notify the other modules when new data or services are available.\n\n## Technical Decisions\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n- Backend: Python (Django or Flask)\n- Frontend: React.js\n- Database: PostgreSQL\n- API: RESTful API\n- Security: JWT for authentication, HTTPS for secure data transmission\n\n### Database Design\n\nThe database includes tables for strategies, market data, analysis results, and integration data. Each table includes fields for the data elements required by the corresponding module.\n\n### API Design\n\nThe API provides endpoints for managing strategies, market data, analysis results, and integration data. It supports operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.\n\n### Security Architecture\n\nThe security architecture includes measures for authentication, authorization, data encryption, and secure data transmission. It uses JWT for authentication, role-based access control for authorization, AES for data encryption, and HTTPS for secure data transmission.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Model\n\nThe application is deployed on a cloud-based platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP) using a microservices architecture. Each module is deployed as a separate service.\n\n### Scaling Strategy\n\nThe application uses horizontal scaling to handle increased load. New instances of the services are created as needed and load balancing is used to distribute the load.\n\n### Monitoring Approach\n\nThe application uses a monitoring tool (e.g., Prometheus or Grafana) to track system performance and resource usage. Alerts are set up to notify the team of any issues.\n\n### Backup/Recovery\n\nThe application uses regular backups and a disaster recovery plan to protect against data loss. The backups are stored in a separate location and the recovery plan includes steps for restoring the system and data.\n\n# Mermaid.js Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[Trading Strategy Development Module] -- Interacts with --> B[Market Analysis Module]\nA -- Interacts with --> D[Data Management Module]\nB -- Interacts with --> D\nC[Integration Module] -- Interacts with --> A\nC -- Interacts with --> B\nC -- Interacts with --> D\nC -- Data flows to --> A\nC -- Data flows to --> B\nA -- Processed data flows to --> D\nB -- Processed data flows to --> D\n```\n\nThis diagram shows the interactions and data flow between the system components. The arrows represent the direction of the interactions and data flow.",
    "refinement": "# Recommendations\n\n## Performance\n\n1. **Optimization Opportunities:** Consider implementing asynchronous programming in the Integration Module to handle multiple API calls simultaneously. This can be achieved using Python's asyncio library.\n2. **Bottleneck Prevention:** To prevent the Data Management Module from becoming a bottleneck, consider implementing a distributed database system. This can be achieved using PostgreSQL's built-in replication features.\n3. **Resource Utilization:** To optimize resource utilization, consider implementing auto-scaling in the cloud platform. This can be achieved using AWS's Auto Scaling service or similar services in other cloud platforms.\n4. **Caching Strategies:** To improve performance, consider implementing caching in the Market Analysis Module and the Trading Strategy Development Module. This can be achieved using Python's built-in caching features or external libraries like Redis.\n\n## Reliability\n\n1. **Error Handling:** To improve error handling, consider implementing a centralized error logging system. This can be achieved using Python's logging module and a log management service like Loggly or Splunk.\n2. **Fault Tolerance:** To improve fault tolerance, consider implementing a health check system for the services. This can be achieved using a monitoring tool like Prometheus or Grafana.\n3. **Recovery Procedures:** To improve recovery procedures, consider implementing a failover system for the database. This can be achieved using PostgreSQL's built-in failover features.\n4. **Data Consistency:** To ensure data consistency, consider implementing a transaction management system in the Data Management Module. This can be achieved using Django's or Flask's built-in transaction management features.\n\n## Maintainability\n\n1. **Code Organization:** To improve code organization, consider implementing a modular design pattern. This can be achieved by dividing the code into separate modules based on functionality.\n2. **Documentation Needs:** To improve documentation, consider implementing a documentation generation tool. This can be achieved using a tool like Sphinx for Python.\n3. **Testing Strategy:** To improve the testing strategy, consider implementing a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This can be achieved using a tool like Jenkins or Travis CI.\n4. **Deployment Process:** To improve the deployment process, consider implementing a containerization tool. This can be achieved using a tool like Docker or Kubernetes.",
    "completion": "# Implementation Guidance\n\n## Development Plan\n\n1. **Component development order:** Start with the development of the Data Management Module as it is the core of the system. Follow it up with the Integration Module, Market Analysis Module, and finally the Trading Strategy Development Module.\n\n2. **Integration steps:** After the development of each module, integrate it with the Data Management Module. Ensure that data flows correctly between the modules and that the modules can communicate with each other.\n\n3. **Testing requirements:** Write unit tests for each function and method in the modules. Also, write integration tests to ensure that the modules work correctly when integrated.\n\n4. **Deployment procedure:** Use a containerization tool like Docker to package the application and its dependencies into a container. Then, use a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes to manage the deployment of the containers.\n\n## Quality Assurance\n\n1. **Test cases:** Write test cases that cover all the functionalities of the modules. Ensure that the test cases cover both positive and negative scenarios.\n\n2. **Performance benchmarks:** Set performance benchmarks for the system. The system should be able to handle a certain number of API calls per second, process a certain amount of data per second, etc.\n\n3. **Security checks:** Conduct security checks to ensure that the system is secure. Check for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.\n\n4. **Acceptance criteria:** Define acceptance criteria for the system. The system should meet these criteria before it is considered ready for deployment.\n\n## Documentation\n\n1. **API documentation:** Document all the APIs in the system. Include information like the endpoint, request method, request parameters, response format, etc.\n\n2. **User guides:** Write user guides that explain how to use the system. Include step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.\n\n3. **Deployment guides:** Write deployment guides that explain how to deploy the system. Include information like the required hardware and software, installation steps, configuration steps, etc.\n\n4. **Maintenance procedures:** Document the procedures for maintaining the system. Include information like how to update the system, how to backup and restore the system, how to monitor the system, etc."

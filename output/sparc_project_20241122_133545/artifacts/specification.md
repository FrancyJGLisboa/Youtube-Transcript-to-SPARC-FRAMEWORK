# Software Requirements Specification

## 1. System Overview
The project aims to develop a web-based application that leverages AI and E-commerce technologies to automate AI agents, process payments, implement metered billing, and provide a chatbot interface. The target audience includes businesses and individuals who require automated AI services and payment processing. The system will be developed using JavaScript, Next.js, Stripe API, and OpenAI API. The project assumes that access to the Stripe issuing API will be granted and that API keys will be securely handled.

## 2. Functional Requirements
### 2.1 Core Features
- **Automations of AI agents**: The system will automate AI agents using the OpenAI API. The AI agents will be capable of performing various tasks based on user requirements.
- **Payment processing**: The system will process payments using the Stripe API. Users will be able to make payments for the services they use.
- **Metered billing**: The system will implement metered billing, charging users based on their usage of the services.
- **Chatbot**: The system will provide a chatbot interface for users to interact with the AI agents.

### 2.2 User Interactions
Users will interact with the system through a landing page, a payment link creation interface, a chat interface, and a meter setup interface. The system will provide clear error messages and handle errors gracefully to ensure a smooth user experience.

### 2.3 External Interfaces
The system will integrate with the Stripe API for payment processing and the OpenAI API for automating AI agents. The system will handle API keys securely to protect user data.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Performance Requirements
The system will be designed to handle a high volume of user interactions and API calls. It will be scalable to accommodate growth in user base and service usage.

### 3.2 Security Requirements
The system will implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data. It will securely handle API keys to prevent unauthorized access to user data.

### 3.3 Quality Attributes
The system will be reliable, available, maintainable, and monitorable. It will be designed to minimize downtime and maximize user satisfaction.

## 4. System Constraints
The system's development and operation will be constrained by the need to secure access to the Stripe issuing API and the need to securely handle API keys. It will also be constrained by the capabilities of the underlying technologies (JavaScript, Next.js, Stripe API, OpenAI API).

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
The system will be considered complete when it can automate AI agents, process payments, implement metered billing, and provide a chatbot interface. It will need to meet performance benchmarks, quality metrics, and testing requirements. It will also need to securely handle API keys and integrate with the Stripe and OpenAI APIs.

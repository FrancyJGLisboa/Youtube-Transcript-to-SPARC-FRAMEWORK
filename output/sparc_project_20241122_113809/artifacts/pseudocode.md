# Note: The actual implementation of the methods for identifying trends and correlations, back-testing and forward-testing strategies, reverse engineering market moves, copying strategies, refining strategies, and integrating with platforms, scanners, and tools would depend on the specific requirements and available APIs or libraries.

This pseudocode provides a high-level overview of the main components and flow control of the trading strategy development application. It includes the core features and integration points specified in the requirements, as well as error handling and state management. The actual implementation would also need to consider the non-functional requirements and system constraints, such as performance metrics, scalability requirements, security needs, reliability expectations, technical limitations, resource constraints, and compliance needs.

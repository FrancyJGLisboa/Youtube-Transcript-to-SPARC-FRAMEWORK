To create a comprehensive system architecture based on your provided requirements, let's break down each section systematically, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and reliability.

## 1. System Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architecture Style
- **Selected Architecture Pattern(s):** 
  - **Microservices Architecture:** This pattern allows for independent deployment and scaling of services, which is essential for handling different components like payment processing and virtual card management.
  - **Justification for Choices:**
    - **Scalability:** Each service can be scaled independently based on its load.
    - **Maintainability:** Services are decoupled, making it easier to update or refactor individual components without affecting others.
    - **Reliability:** Failures in one service can be isolated, reducing the impact on the overall system.
  - **Key Quality Attributes Addressed:**
    - Scalability: Through independent scaling of microservices.
    - Maintainability: Via decoupled service design.
    - Reliability: Through service isolation and fault tolerance.

### 1.2 System Context

  title System Context Diagram
  Boundary(User)[User] {
    Component(App)[Application]
  }
  Boundary(ExternalSystems)[External Systems] {
    Component(StripeAPI)[Stripe API]
    Component(OpenAIAPI)[OpenAI API]
  }
  Rel(User, App, "Interacts with")
  Rel(App, StripeAPI, "Uses for payment processing")
  Rel(App, OpenAIAPI, "Uses for data analysis")
```

## 2. Component Design

### 2.1 Core Components
```mermaid

  title Core Components Diagram
  Container(App, "Application", "Microservices") {
    Component(PaymentLinkManager, "PaymentLinkManager", "Service")
    Component(BillingManager, "BillingManager", "Service")
    Component(VirtualCardManager, "VirtualCardManager", "Service")
  }
  Rel(PaymentLinkManager, StripeAPI, "Creates and manages payment links")
  Rel(BillingManager, Database, "Stores and retrieves usage data")
  Rel(VirtualCardManager, PaymentProcessorAPI, "Manages virtual cards")
```

### 2.2 Data Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant App as Application
  participant Stripe as Stripe API

  User ->> App: Request to create payment link
  App ->> Stripe: API call to create payment link
  Stripe -->> App: Payment link details
  App -->> User: Display payment link

  User ->> App: Request billing report
  App ->> Database: Fetch usage data
  Database -->> App: Usage data
  App -->> User: Display billing report
```

## 3. Technology Stack

### 3.1 Selected Technologies
- **Infrastructure Choices:** 
  - **Cloud Provider:** AWS or Google Cloud for scalability and reliability.
  - **Containerization:** Docker for consistent deployment environments.
  - **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for managing microservices.
- **Framework Selection:** 
  - **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js for the REST API.
  - **Frontend:** React.js for a responsive user interface.
- **Database Decisions:** 
  - **Relational Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data.
  - **NoSQL Database:** MongoDB for flexible data storage when needed.
- **Third-party Services:** 
  - **Payment Processing:** Stripe API.
  - **Data Analysis:** OpenAI API for advanced data processing.

### 3.2 Integration Architecture
```mermaid

  title Integration Patterns Diagram
  Component(App, "Application", "Microservices")
  Component(StripeAPI, "Stripe API", "External Service")
  Component(OpenAIAPI, "OpenAI API", "External Service")
  Component(Database, "Database", "Data Storage")

  Rel(App, StripeAPI, "REST API Calls")
  Rel(App, OpenAIAPI, "REST API Calls")
  Rel(App, Database, "JDBC/ODBC for SQL, MongoDB Driver for NoSQL")
```

## 4. Deployment Architecture

### 4.1 Deployment Model
```mermaid
deploymentDiagram
  node "Cloud Provider" {
    node "Kubernetes Cluster" {
      component "PaymentLinkManager"
      component "BillingManager"
      component "VirtualCardManager"
    }
    database "PostgreSQL" {
      component "UsageDataStore"
    }
    database "MongoDB" {
      component "FlexibleDataStore"
    }
  }
```

### 4.2 Infrastructure Requirements
- **Scaling Strategy:** 
  - Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling to adjust the number of pod instances based on CPU and memory usage.
- **High Availability Approach:** 
  - Deploy services across multiple availability zones and use load balancers to distribute traffic.
- **Disaster Recovery Plan:** 
  - Implement automated database backups and use a multi-region replication strategy to ensure data availability and integrity during failures.

This architecture is designed to be comprehensive, addressing critical aspects of scalability, maintainability, and reliability by leveraging modern cloud-native technologies and design patterns.

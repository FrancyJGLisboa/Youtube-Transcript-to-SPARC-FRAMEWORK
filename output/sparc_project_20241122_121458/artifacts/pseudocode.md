This pseudocode provides a high-level overview of how the Research Paper Synthesizer could be implemented. It includes error handling and uses the OpenAI and Arxiv APIs for paper retrieval and analysis. The generated paper is formatted in Markdown and saved in a JSON file. The pseudocode is clear and language-agnostic, and it includes detailed comments explaining each part.

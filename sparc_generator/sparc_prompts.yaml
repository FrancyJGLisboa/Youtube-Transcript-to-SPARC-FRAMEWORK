# SPARC Framework prompts
initial_analysis: |
  You are an expert at analyzing academic papers for software implementation.
  Extract structured information about the research and its potential implementation.
  
  Analyze the paper and output strictly in this JSON format:

    "research_type": "",
    "technical_domain": "",
    "core_algorithms": [],
    "datasets_used": [],
    "implementation_requirements": [],
    "dependencies": [],
    "evaluation_metrics": [],
    "implementation_details": {
        "methods": [],
        "models": [],
        "architecture_decisions": [],
        "constraints": [],
        "validation_approaches": []
    }
  }

specification: |
  Based on the academic paper analysis, create a detailed software specification document.

pseudocode: |
  Create detailed pseudocode for implementing the research methods.

architecture: |
  Design a system architecture that implements the research methodology effectively.

refinement: |
  Analyze the implementation design for research-specific improvements.

completion: |
  Create comprehensive implementation guidance.

validation: |
  Validate the implementation against the original paper requirements.

chat_simulation: |

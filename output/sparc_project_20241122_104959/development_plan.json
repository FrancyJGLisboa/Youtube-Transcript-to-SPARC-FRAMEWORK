Technical Decisions\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n- Python: Main programming language.\n- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.\n- Numpy: Numerical computations.\n- Requests: HTTP requests to Yahoo Finance API.\n- Matplotlib: Data visualization for performance reports.\n\n### Database Design\n\nNo database is needed for this system as it operates on real-time data fetched from Yahoo Finance API.\n\n### API Design\n\nThe system uses Yahoo Finance API to fetch stock data. No additional APIs are designed.\n\n### Security Architecture\n\nThe system does not handle sensitive data, so no specific security measures are needed.\n\n## 3. Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Model\n\nThe system can be deployed as a standalone application on a user's machine.\n\n### Scaling Strategy\n\nThe system can be scaled up by increasing the computational resources (CPU and RAM) of the machine it's running on.\n\n### Monitoring Approach\n\nThe system can be monitored by logging its operations and checking the logs for errors.\n\n### Backup/Recovery\n\nSince the system operates on real-time data and does not store any data, no backup/recovery measures are needed.\n\n## Mermaid.js Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Data Fetcher] --> B[Data Processor]\n    B --> C[Monte Carlo Simulator]\n    C --> D[Price Predictor]\n    D --> E[Trading Simulator]\n    E --> F[Report Generator]\n```",
    "refinement": "# Recommendations for Improvement\n\n## 1. Performance\n\n- **Optimization opportunities**: The Monte Carlo Simulator and Price Predictor components can be optimized using parallel processing techniques to speed up simulations and predictions.\n- **Bottleneck prevention**: To prevent bottlenecks, the system could be designed to fetch and process data in parallel. This would require a redesign of the Data Fetcher and Data Processor components.\n- **Resource utilization**: The system could be designed to use resources more efficiently by processing data in chunks instead of all at once. This would reduce memory usage.\n- **Caching strategies**: The system could cache the results of simulations and predictions to speed up subsequent runs. This would require a redesign of the Monte Carlo Simulator and Price Predictor components.\n\n## 2. Reliability\n\n- **Error handling**: The system should be designed to handle errors gracefully. This could be achieved by adding error handling code to each component.\n- **Fault tolerance**: The system should be designed to be fault-tolerant. This could be achieved by adding redundancy to critical components.\n- **Recovery procedures**: The system should be designed with recovery procedures in mind. This could be achieved by adding rollback functionality to each component.\n- **Data consistency**: The system should be designed to ensure data consistency. This could be achieved by adding data validation checks to the Data Processor component.\n\n## 3. Maintainability\n\n- **Code organization**: The code should be organized in a modular way, with each component in its own module. This would make the code easier to understand and maintain.\n- **Documentation needs**: The system should be thoroughly documented, with comments in the code and a comprehensive README file.\n- **Testing strategy**: The system should be designed with testing in mind. This could be achieved by writing unit tests for each component and integration tests for the whole system.\n- **Deployment process**: The deployment process should be automated using a tool like Docker or Kubernetes. This would make the system easier to deploy and scale.\n\n## 4. Security\n\n- Although the system does not handle sensitive data, it's always a good practice to implement basic security measures. This could include validating input data to prevent injection attacks and encrypting communication with the Yahoo Finance API.\n\n## 5. Infrastructure\n\n- **Deployment Model**: Consider deploying the system in the cloud (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) to take advantage of scalable resources and managed services.\n- **Scaling Strategy**: Consider using auto-scaling features provided by cloud platforms to automatically adjust resources based on demand.\n- **Monitoring Approach**: Consider using a monitoring service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Google Stackdriver) to monitor system performance and alert on issues.\n- **Backup/Recovery**: Even though the system operates on real-time data, consider implementing a backup/recovery strategy for the system configuration and codebase.",

The Monte Carlo Simulator should pass simulation results to the Price Predictor for prediction.\n\n### Testing requirements\n\nEach component should be unit tested individually. Once all components are integrated, the whole system should be integration tested.\n\n### Deployment procedure\n\nThe system should be deployed using Docker or Kubernetes for easy scalability and management.\n\n## 2. Quality Assurance\n\n### Test cases\n\nTest cases should cover all possible scenarios, including edge cases and failure modes.\n\n### Performance benchmarks\n\nPerformance benchmarks should be established to ensure that the system meets performance requirements.

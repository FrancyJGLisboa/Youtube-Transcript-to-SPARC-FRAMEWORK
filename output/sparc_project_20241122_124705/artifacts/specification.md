# Research Paper Synthesizer Specification

## 1. Functional Requirements

### Core Features with Acceptance Criteria
- **Paper Retrieval**: The system should be able to retrieve research papers based on user input. Acceptance criteria: Given a list of research papers, the system should retrieve the full text of each paper.
- **Combination Analysis**: The system should be able to analyze multiple papers and identify common themes and findings. Acceptance criteria: Given the full text of multiple papers, the system should output a list of common themes and findings.
- **Paper Generation**: The system should be able to generate a new research paper based on the analysis. Acceptance criteria: Given a list of common themes and findings, the system should output a well-structured research paper.
- **Markdown Formatting**: The system should be able to format the generated paper in Markdown. Acceptance criteria: Given a generated research paper, the system should output a Markdown-formatted version of the paper.

### User Interactions and Workflows
- Users input a list of research papers.
- The system retrieves the full text of each paper.
- The system analyzes the papers and identifies common themes and findings.
- The system generates a new research paper based on the analysis.
- The system formats the generated paper in Markdown.

### Data Processing Requirements
- The system must be able to process large amounts of text data (full research papers).
- The system must be able to handle JSON data for storage and retrieval.

### Integration Points
- The system must integrate with the OpenAI and arxiv APIs for paper retrieval and analysis.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Metrics
- The system should retrieve and analyze papers within a reasonable time frame (to be determined based on testing and user feedback).
- The system should generate and format papers with minimal errors.

### Scalability Requirements
- The system should be able to handle an increasing number of papers without significant performance degradation.

### Security Needs
- The system should securely store and handle API keys.

### Reliability Expectations
- The system should have a high availability and low failure rate.

## 3. System Constraints

### Technical Limitations
- The system must be developed using Python 3.9+.
- The system requires an internet connection.

### Resource Constraints
- The system requires access to the OpenAI and arxiv APIs.

### Integration Requirements
- The system must integrate with the OpenAI and arxiv APIs.
- The system must be able to handle JSON data for storage and retrieval.

### Compliance Needs
- The system must comply with the terms of use of the OpenAI and arxiv APIs.

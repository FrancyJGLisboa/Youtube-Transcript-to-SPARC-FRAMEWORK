# Pseudocode Implementation

## 1. Core Components

```python
# Main class for the application
class ResearchPaperSynthesizer:
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, paper_ids):
        self.paper_ids = paper_ids
        self.papers = []

    # Function to retrieve papers from Arxiv API
    def retrieve_papers(self):
        for id in self.paper_ids:
            # Call Arxiv API and store the result in a variable
            paper = ArxivAPI.get_paper(id)
            self.papers.append(paper)

    # Function to analyze and combine papers
    def combine_papers(self):
        # Use GPT-3 to analyze and combine the papers
        combined_paper = GPT3.analyze_and_combine(self.papers)
        return combined_paper

    # Function to format the combined paper in Markdown
    def format_paper(self, combined_paper):
        # Format the combined paper in Markdown
        formatted_paper = MarkdownFormatter.format(combined_paper)
        return formatted_paper

    # Function to generate a new research paper
    def generate_paper(self, formatted_paper):
        # Generate a new research paper based on the formatted paper
        new_paper = PaperGenerator.generate(formatted_paper)
        return new_paper
```

## 2. Flow Control

```python
# Main function to control the flow of the application
def main():
    # Get paper IDs from the user
    paper_ids = UserInput.get_paper_ids()

    # Create an instance of the ResearchPaperSynthesizer class
    synthesizer = ResearchPaperSynthesizer(paper_ids)

    try:
        # Retrieve the papers
        synthesizer.retrieve_papers()

        # Combine the papers
        combined_paper = synthesizer.combine_papers()

        # Format the combined paper
        formatted_paper = synthesizer.format_paper(combined_paper)

        # Generate a new research paper
        new_paper = synthesizer.generate_paper(formatted_paper)

        # Show the new paper to the user
        UserOutput.show_paper(new_paper)

    except Exception as e:
        # Handle errors and show an error message to the user
        UserOutput.show_error(e)
```

## 3. Integration Points

```python
# Class to interact with the Arxiv API
class ArxivAPI:
    @staticmethod
    def get_paper(id):
        # Call the Arxiv API and return the result
        return api_call_result

# Class to interact with OpenAI GPT-3
class GPT3:
    @staticmethod
    def analyze_and_combine(papers):
        # Use GPT-3 to analyze and combine the papers
        return combined_paper
```

Note: This pseudocode is a high-level representation of the system. It does not include all the necessary error checking, data validation, and state management. It also assumes that the Arxiv API and OpenAI GPT-3 provide the necessary functionality. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.

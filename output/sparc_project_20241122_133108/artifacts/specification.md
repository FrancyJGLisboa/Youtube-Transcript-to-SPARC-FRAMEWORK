# Research Paper Synthesizer Specification

## 1. Functional Requirements

### Core Features with Acceptance Criteria
1. **Paper Retrieval:** The application should be able to retrieve research papers from the Arxiv API. The retrieval should be successful given a valid paper identifier.
2. **Paper Combination Analysis:** The application should be able to analyze and combine different research papers. The combination should make logical sense and maintain the integrity of the original papers.
3. **Paper Formatting:** The application should be able to format the synthesized paper in Markdown. The formatting should be consistent and clear.
4. **Paper Generation:** The application should be able to generate a new research paper based on the combined and formatted papers. The generated paper should be coherent and maintain the academic standards of a research paper.

### User Interactions and Workflows
1. The user provides a set of research papers to the application.
2. The application retrieves the papers, analyzes and combines them.
3. The application formats the combined paper in Markdown.
4. The application generates a new research paper and presents it to the user.

### Data Processing Requirements
1. The application should be able to process JSON data from the Arxiv API.
2. The application should be able to process and analyze text data from the research papers.
3. The application should be able to generate Markdown formatted text.

### Integration Points
1. The application should integrate with the Arxiv API for paper retrieval.
2. The application should integrate with OpenAI GPT-3 for natural language processing.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Metrics
1. The application should be able to retrieve a paper from the Arxiv API within a reasonable time.
2. The application should be able to process and generate a new paper within a reasonable time.

### Scalability Requirements
1. The application should be able to handle an increasing number of research papers.
2. The application should be able to handle larger research papers.

### Security Needs
1. The application should securely handle and store research papers.
2. The application should securely communicate with the Arxiv API and OpenAI GPT-3.

### Reliability Expectations

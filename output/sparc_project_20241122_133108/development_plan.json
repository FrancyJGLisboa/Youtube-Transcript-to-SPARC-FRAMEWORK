    "architecture": "# System Architecture\n\n## 1. Component Design\n\n### System Components\n\nThe system is composed of the following main components:\n\n1. User Interface: This is the component through which users interact with the system. It collects paper IDs from the user and displays the synthesized research paper.\n\n2. Research Paper Synthesizer: This is the core component of the system. It retrieves papers from the Arxiv API, analyzes and combines them using GPT-3, formats the combined paper in Markdown, and generates a new research paper.\n\n3. Arxiv API: This component provides access to research papers based on their IDs.\n\n4. GPT-3: This component analyzes and combines the retrieved papers.\n\n5. Markdown Formatter: This component formats the combined paper in Markdown.\n\n6. Paper Generator: This component generates a new research paper based on the formatted paper.\n\n### Component Interactions\n\nThe User Interface interacts with the Research Paper Synthesizer, which in turn interacts with the Arxiv API, GPT-3, Markdown Formatter, and Paper Generator.\n\n### Data Flow\n\nThe data flows from the User Interface to the Research Paper Synthesizer, which retrieves papers from the Arxiv API, analyzes and combines them using GPT-3, formats the combined paper in Markdown, and generates a new research paper. The synthesized paper is then returned to the User Interface for display.\n\n### Integration Patterns\n\nThe system uses the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) integration pattern. The Arxiv API and GPT-3 are external services that the Research Paper Synthesizer interacts with.\n\n## 2. Technical Decisions\n\n### Technology Stack\n\nThe system can be implemented using the following technology stack:\n\n- Frontend: React.js for the User Interface.\n- Backend: Python for the Research Paper Synthesizer, with Flask or Django as the web framework.\n- External Services: Arxiv API for retrieving papers and OpenAI GPT-3 for analyzing and combining papers.\n\n### Database Design\n\nSince the system does not need to store any data, a database is not required.\n\n### API Design\n\nThe system interacts with the Arxiv API to retrieve papers and with OpenAI GPT-3 to analyze and combine papers.\n\n### Security Architecture\n\nThe system needs to ensure secure communication with the Arxiv API and OpenAI GPT-3. This can be achieved by using HTTPS for all API calls and by securely storing and handling API keys.\n\n## 3. Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Model\n\nThe system can be deployed on a cloud platform like AWS or Google Cloud.\n\n### Scaling Strategy\n\nThe system can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances as the load increases. Load balancing can be used to distribute the load among the instances.\n\n### Monitoring Approach\n\nThe system can be monitored using tools like AWS CloudWatch or Google Stackdriver.\n\n### Backup/Recovery\n\nSince the system does not store any data, backup and recovery are not required.\n\n# Mermaid.js Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[User Interface] --> B[Research Paper Synthesizer]\n    B --> C[Arxiv API]\n    B --> D[GPT-3]\n    B --> E[Markdown Formatter]\n    B --> F[Paper Generator]\n    B --> A\n```\n\nIn this diagram, the arrows represent the direction of data flow. The User Interface sends paper IDs to the Research Paper Synthesizer, which retrieves papers from the Arxiv API, analyzes and combines them using GPT-3, formats the combined paper in Markdown, generates a new research paper, and sends it back to the User Interface.",
    "refinement": "# Recommendations\n\n## Performance\n\n### Optimization Opportunities\n\n1. **Asynchronous Processing**: Since the system interacts with external services (Arxiv API and GPT-3), these operations can be made asynchronous to improve performance. Python's asyncio library can be used for this purpose.\n\n2. **Parallel Processing**: If multiple papers are being synthesized at the same time, these operations can be processed in parallel to reduce the overall time. Python's multiprocessing library can be used for this purpose.\n\n### Bottleneck Prevention\n\n1. **Rate Limiting**: To prevent the system from being overwhelmed by too many requests at once, implement rate limiting. This can be done at the API level using a library like Flask-Limiter.\n\n2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implement the circuit breaker pattern to prevent the system from repeatedly trying to perform an operation that's likely to fail. This can be done using a library like pybreaker.\n\n### Resource Utilization\n\n1. **Load Balancing**: To ensure that resources are utilized efficiently, implement load balancing. This can be done at the infrastructure level using a service like AWS Elastic Load Balancer.\n\n### Caching Strategies\n\n1. **Caching Responses**: Cache responses from the Arxiv API and GPT-3 to reduce the number of requests made to these services. This can be done using a library like Flask-Caching.\n\n## Reliability\n\n### Error Handling\n\n1. **Exception Handling**: Implement robust exception handling to ensure that the system can recover from errors gracefully. This should be done throughout the codebase.\n\n### Fault Tolerance\n\n1. **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for operations that might fail, such as API calls. This can be done using a library like tenacity.\n\n### Recovery Procedures\n\n1. **Rollback Mechanism**: Implement a rollback mechanism to undo changes in case of a failure. This is particularly important for operations that modify data.\n\n### Data Consistency\n\n1. **Data Validation**: Validate data before processing it to ensure consistency. This can be done using a library like Marshmallow.\n\n## Maintainability\n\n### Code Organization\n\n1. **Modular Design**: Organize the code into modules based on functionality to improve maintainability. This will make it easier to understand, modify, and test the code.\n\n### Documentation Needs\n\n1. **Code Comments**: Add comments to the code to explain what it does. This will make it easier for other developers to understand the code.\n\n2. **API Documentation**: Document the API endpoints, request/response formats, and error codes. This can be done using a tool like Swagger.\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for all functions and methods to ensure that they work as expected. This can be done using a library like pytest.\n\n2. **Integration Testing**: Write integration tests to ensure that the components of the system work together correctly.\n\n### Deployment Process\n\n1. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing and deployment process. This can be done using a service like Jenkins or Travis CI.\n\n## Security\n\n1. **API Key Management**: Store API keys securely using a service like AWS Secrets Manager.\n\n2. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS for all API calls to ensure secure communication.\n\n3. **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.\n\n4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n1. **Auto-Scaling**: Use an auto-scaling service to automatically adjust the number of instances based on the load.\n\n2. **Monitoring**: Use a monitoring service to track the system's performance and alert when there are issues.\n\n3. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging to help with debugging and identifying issues.",

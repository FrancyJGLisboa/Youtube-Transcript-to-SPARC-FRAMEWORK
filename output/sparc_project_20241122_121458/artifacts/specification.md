# Research Paper Synthesizer Specification

## 1. Functional Requirements

### Core Features with Acceptance Criteria

1. **Retrieve Research Papers**
   - The system must be able to retrieve research papers from the Arxiv API based on a valid search term.
   - The system should return an error message if the search term is invalid.

2. **Analyze and Combine Papers**
   - The system must be able to analyze the content of the retrieved papers using Natural Language Processing.
   - The system should be able to combine the analyzed papers into a coherent structure.

3. **Generate New Research Paper**
   - The system must be able to generate a new research paper based on the combined analysis of the retrieved papers.
   - The generated paper should be coherent and follow a standard research paper structure.

4. **Format and Save Results**
   - The system must be able to format the generated paper in Markdown.
   - The system should be able to save the formatted paper in a JSON file.

### User Interactions and Workflows

- The user inputs a valid search term.
- The system retrieves relevant research papers.
- The system analyzes and combines the papers.
- The system generates a new research paper.
- The system formats and saves the paper.

### Data Processing Requirements

- The system must be able to process text data from research papers.
- The system should be able to handle JSON data for storage and retrieval.

### Integration Points

- The system must integrate with the Arxiv API for paper retrieval.
- The system must integrate with the OpenAI API for natural language processing.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Metrics

- The system should retrieve research papers within a reasonable time frame.
- The system should generate the new research paper within a reasonable time frame.

### Scalability Requirements

- The system should be able to handle an increase in the number of research papers retrieved.

### Security Needs

- The system should securely store the OpenAI API key.
- The system should handle errors gracefully and not expose sensitive information in error messages.

### Reliability Expectations

- The system should have a high availability and low failure rate.
- The system should provide accurate and reliable results.

## 3. System Constraints

### Technical Limitations

- The system requires an internet connection.
- The system is dependent on the availability and functionality of the OpenAI and Arxiv APIs.

### Resource Constraints

- The system's performance is dependent on the resources of the machine it's running on.

### Integration Requirements

- The system requires an OpenAI API key for integration with the OpenAI API.
- The system requires the arxiv, openai, json, datetime, os, and re Python libraries.

### Compliance Needs

- The system must comply with the terms of use of the OpenAI and Arxiv APIs.
- The system must handle and store data in compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

# Implementation Guidance

## 1. Development Plan

### Component development order

1. **Data Fetcher**: This component is responsible for fetching data from the Yahoo Finance API. It should be developed first because other components depend on it.
2. **Data Processor**: This component processes the fetched data and prepares it for simulation and prediction. It should be developed second.
3. **Monte Carlo Simulator**: This component uses the processed data to run simulations. It should be developed third.
4. **Price Predictor**: This component uses the results of the simulations to predict future prices. It should be developed last.

### Integration steps

1. **Data Fetcher and Data Processor**: Once both components are developed, they should be integrated. The Data Fetcher should pass fetched data to the Data Processor for processing.
2. **Data Processor and Monte Carlo Simulator**: Once the Data Processor is integrated with the Data Fetcher, it should be integrated with the Monte Carlo Simulator. The Data Processor should pass processed data to the Monte Carlo Simulator for simulation.
3. **Monte Carlo Simulator and Price Predictor**: Once the Monte Carlo Simulator is integrated with the Data Processor, it should be integrated with the Price Predictor. The Monte Carlo Simulator should pass simulation results to the Price Predictor for prediction.

### Testing requirements

Each component should be unit tested individually. Once all components are integrated, the whole system should be integration tested.

### Deployment procedure

The system should be deployed using Docker or Kubernetes for easy scalability and management.

## 2. Quality Assurance

### Test cases

Test cases should cover all possible scenarios, including edge cases and failure modes.

### Performance benchmarks

Performance benchmarks should be established to ensure that the system meets performance requirements. These benchmarks should be based on the expected load and response time.

### Security checks

Security checks should include input validation to prevent injection attacks and encryption of communication with the Yahoo Finance API.

### Acceptance criteria

Acceptance criteria should be defined to ensure that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

## 3. Documentation

### API documentation

API documentation should be provided to help users understand how to use the system.

### User guides

User guides should be provided to help users understand how to use the system.

### Deployment guides

Deployment guides should be provided to help users understand how to deploy the system.

### Maintenance procedures

Maintenance procedures should be provided to help users understand how to maintain the system.

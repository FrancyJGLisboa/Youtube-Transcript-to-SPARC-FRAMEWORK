    "refinement": "## Recommendations\n\n### Performance\n\n1. **Optimization Opportunities**: The AI Prediction Model can be optimized by using GPU-accelerated computing if the model is complex and requires high computational power. This can be achieved by using libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch that support GPU computing.\n\n2. **Bottleneck Prevention**: The system might face bottlenecks when fetching data from Yahoo Finance API if multiple users are requesting data at the same time. To prevent this, implement a queue system to manage the API requests. \n\n3. **Resource Utilization**: To improve resource utilization, consider implementing a load balancer to distribute the workload evenly across the system. AWS provides Elastic Load Balancing service that can be used for this purpose.\n\n4. **Caching Strategies**: Implement caching to store frequently accessed data, such as popular stock data, to reduce the number of API calls to Yahoo Finance. Redis can be used for caching in this case.\n\n### Reliability\n\n1. **Error Handling**: Implement a robust error handling mechanism to catch and handle exceptions and errors. This includes handling API failures, simulation errors, and prediction errors.\n\n2. **Fault Tolerance**: Implement a microservices architecture to ensure that failure of one component does not affect the entire system. Each component (Monte Carlo Simulation, Trading Simulation, AI Prediction Model, etc.) can be a separate microservice.\n\n3. **Recovery Procedures**: Regularly backup data using AWS's backup services. In case of a system failure, the system should be able to recover from the latest backup.\n\n4. **Data Consistency**: Use transactions to ensure data consistency. If the system fails during an operation, the transaction should be rolled back to maintain data consistency.\n\n### Maintainability\n\n1. **Code Organization**: Follow a modular approach to code organization. Each component should be a separate module with clear interfaces.\n\n2. **Documentation Needs**: Document all the components, their interfaces, and their functionalities. This will help in maintaining and updating the system in the future.\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Implement unit tests for each component and integration tests for the entire system. Use a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n\n4. **Deployment Process**: Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration to simplify the deployment process. This will also help in scaling the system in the future.",

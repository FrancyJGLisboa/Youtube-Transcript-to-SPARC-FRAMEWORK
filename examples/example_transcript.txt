0:07

0:15
and how to grow an online directory using Ai and SEO and he just walks
0:20
through the entire process people are making 5K 10K 15K 20K a month uh with
0:27
these online directories they're super easy to create he thinks it's one of the lowest risk uh ways to start a startup
0:36
I'll let you decide enjoy the [Music]
0:47
episode we got John Rush the king of directories on the Pod you've heard it
0:53
you've heard him here before but today is a special episode because what are we learning today John well we'll learn how
Why directories
1:01
to come up with ideas for directories how to validate them before you build
1:06
them how to build them and how to work on SEO once you build them so basically
1:12
all three important steps you have to build successful directories and why you should care
1:19
about this is we're kind of entering this like Golden Era of directories we're starting to see them be more and
1:26
more popular uh people want curation and directories provide that so if you're
1:33
looking for your next startup idea directories is a great place to start and uh I'm excited to to get in
1:41
with this I just like dive deep in directories I haven't done this with you
1:46
I figured you might as well do it publicly yeah that's there smart that's
1:52
100% correct so uh just to add on that the Reon directors are so big now and
1:58
they will be much bigger in the future is that as there's more content on the internet the quality of the content
2:04
becomes more important and I think directors are soling this pretty well because people trust directories if it's
2:12
a good directory they trust it that it's a Well curated content and it has some
2:18
reviews ratings and the quality is high and the person running it understands
2:23
the space and picks the right things there so I think people will be Outsourcing the decision making for for
2:30
the content to the directories from Google because now they ask Google and
2:35
that's uh that's becoming more and more relevant as we see that the top search
2:42
results of the Google are mostly dominated by all the hacks all right
How to find directory ideas
2:47
well let's start with step one how do we find a directory idea that uh is
2:54
worthwhile to go after yeah so there are many ways of doing it but the best way
3:01
is to start based on keyword research so the keyword research is a way to see
3:07
whether people search for certain keywords and certain phrases and even if you think that certain idea is great but
3:16
often other people might not think so and you can figure out whether that's true or not by seeing what Google says
3:21
about that and and Google has this tool called Keyword Planner that people
3:26
usually use to plan their ads but you can also use that tool to see the traffic for directories not for director
3:34
for keywords and I basically spend hours in that tool every day just throwing all
3:41
random ideas into that tool and seeing whether there is traffic or not and I can show on a real example I have even
3:48
an idea I want to test today and I will show you how I would
3:54
test that idea actually right here on the P amazing amazing so while you're
4:00
pulling that up today's episode uh it's going to be like a live cooking session like we're going to find
4:06
an idea and we're going to go basically build this idea so if you're listening to this on audio might might be helpful
4:13
to head to to to YouTube yeah so one thing we saw is that
4:19
your podcast has been really great and it been it's been growing the startup
4:25
ideas and the idea I got from this is that that's the hottest part of the
4:31
whole startup Journey now is the ideas and I think the part people struggle the most with are the ideas and I
4:40
think people search a lot for ideas on Google and to validate that I went to
4:46
Google or I will go there now I don't some test before and and we come here
4:53
and we say business ideas now you can remove the filter on us to see the
5:00
whole world it's still in English so and now we're going to see whether
5:06
people search for it and as you see a lot of people search for it business ideas is almost 1 million a month that's
5:14
a lot and competition low uh this competition is is about the ads so
5:20
people don't pay for the ads for this keyword but finding this domain name is
5:27
pretty difficult because the next thing you have to think about about is like I have the keyword and I want to make directory and I want the domain name of
5:34
my directory to match the keyword if there is a match then it's go like for
5:40
example I had this directory called nextjs starters and it was exact match of the keyword exact match like letter
5:47
to letter and I launched that and I open it back in three months and it has a lot of traffic just because it's it's
5:53
perfect and it's do com in this case obviously this will be taken so I I go
6:00
to GoDaddy and I see whether business ideas.com is taken and it's obviously taken so then I have the next group of
6:07
uh keywords here I can s sort them and I can I can just take them one by one and
6:14
test them small business ideas little business ideas online business ideas all of them and
6:22
eventually uh just before the Pod I found one that was available which was
6:29
the mean business ideas and I I bought it so the mini
6:35
business ideas is a domain I will try why it's good so it's basically I will
6:42
explain now how how the domain and the keyword works so the key part here is
6:47
that the Google has made a change where in the old times Google would look at exact word match and now it it looks at
6:55
the meaning more than the actual words and that's why you have this small
7:01
business ideas here which is really high up here and basically can replay small
7:07
with something else that's has the same meaning and if it's available you can
7:12
take it and that's what I did so I tried tiny micro and then the mini was free so
7:19
I bought mini business ideas for $9 I never buy expensive domains like
7:25
it's always available just be more creative and find the one that's available so now I have the domain name main
7:32
business ideas I have the the idea itself so the idea is the director of
7:38
ideas that's pretty funny shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup
7:44
ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these
7:50
aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs
7:56
who' built hundred million plus business businesses I've compiled them into one
8:02
simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but
8:10
the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost
8:16
nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your
8:22
startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business
8:29
is waiting for you and now I will go for the next step which is building the
Building your directory
8:35
directory so there are many ways of building directories and the worst way of building directories is going into
8:42
the code and I am a developer myself a lot of people think I'm a not a developer that's why I always promote no
8:48
code but I've been coding for like 15 years and the reason I always say that
8:54
you should start with no code is this when you do no code you start faster
9:00
because you can use templates but that that's not the most important part the most important part is that once you
9:06
launch you have to do marketing and marketing goes around marketing Pages marketing experiments AB tests and all
9:13
those things and when you and also the blog and and and prog programmatic SEO
9:19
and all those things are usually out of the box on most modern CMS or web
9:26
Builders because they have thought about it that's why they built the whole systems and when you do that with nextjs
9:33
or you hardcode that with PHP you don't really think about the future and maybe
9:38
in the present you may find certain template too or boiler plate for that but then you'll have a lot of problems
9:45
in the future when you have to do the other marketing work because everything has to be done manually and for example
9:51
if you want to find somebody on appwork who will write certain pages for you and
9:57
publish them now you can't do that because it's all in code so you will get some Google doc and you will convert
10:02
that into code so it's all huge hustle and that's why it's even if you know how
10:08
to write code and you're great at that it's 100% better to go with no code
10:14
any tool but I obviously go with my own tool the Unicorn platform and let me
10:19
switch the tab to the other tab now all right so here we are it's a
10:25
unicorn platform like simple website builder that I pivoted
10:32
into into directory Builder I would say because most directories or most
10:38
websites built on unicorn now are directories and that's interesting and so we go here and we say
10:47
create and we find the directories so here are the templates and people always try to over
10:56
complicate things so I have this Discord group called directory makers and a guy
11:03
asked me today like I want to make a directory for lawyers and I want to have this and this and this like 20 features
11:11
and I say at the first launch of your directory the only thing that's
11:16
important is the items like if you put the out the ratings and everything it
11:22
will be empty because there will be no ratings there will be no users so all those features they don't make sense for
11:28
new director so the only thing that makes sense for a new directory is a simple page with a
11:34
name and items and everything else should come later in the month or even a
11:39
year so that's why I always start with very simple directory first so usually
11:44
it's um for example this one so this is probably the simplest one
11:50
here so I pick this all right and I can
11:55
actually simplify my work so I can ask AI to generate oh the directory for me and I
12:04
say directory of meanie mini business which by the way is
12:11
insane I had no idea you can do this oh really that's why I do things really
12:16
fast like people always ask me what's your routine I'm like I use AI for everything but I I do moderate
12:23
everything right so I understand the quality and I add it but I always use AI to start off Min I is
12:30
for people who want to start a small
12:36
site project St student in the
12:43
hackers and another founder all right let's
12:52
see so now it will basically help me to come up with the
12:59
with simple things like a menu and the structure the text the subtitle
13:07
like basically you could do this all by yourself too but why not to save time if
13:12
you can yeah so it's suggest me to basically have uh the directory here and
13:19
then to have uh featured ideas here which is pretty cool because this is uh
13:26
so in the directory everything has to be taken into the into the prism of SEO so
13:34
basically the more text you have the more items you have the more pages you have the more chance to score an SEO for
13:41
those pages and and for example in this case if you have featured ideas uh there's High chance that you can score
13:48
for SEO compared to just the ideas because ideas will be uh smaller items
13:53
and featured ideas you can probably spend time and create longer Pages all
14:01
right so it's pretty much almost done the work and okay now wa few more
14:10
seconds where it's making the futter for me I guess all right so it's making this also FAQ so FAQ is pretty important yeah
14:17
now it's done FAQ is really important too because in FAQ every Title Here is a
14:22
possible question people put in Google that's why the way you usually do with this is is pretty straightforward so you
14:30
go to Google and you try to search for something so you write how do I and then
14:36
it suggests you all the other options that other people search for and that
14:41
makes it obvious what exactly people search for and that's how you can basically for free understand what
14:49
people search for then you put them here uh into this FAQ and you answer those
14:54
questions and then there's a chance you can get traffic for this so I will I will show that which makes so much sense
15:02
if you think about it right it's yeah it's so basic and obvious but you'll be
15:09
surprised that almost Nobody Does it um some things look too easy and people
15:16
don't try it because it's they kind of expect things to be complicated and then being valuable and if something is easy
15:23
to do it feels like it's not valuable because everyone would be doing it so
15:29
uh how to start yeah so here you see so how to
15:36
start a business with no money how to start business as a teenager that's
15:41
interesting I would never think of this how to start a business as a teenager and and that's very good
15:48
keyword right because it's uh it's probably not served well because it's
15:55
not obvious and you could cover that so now I do this research and I write down all
16:02
these questions and then I go back to my uh page where I will cover them right so
16:10
I go here and and I say I ask AI
16:17
uh item for how to start business as a
16:24
tager so I say work for AI and then now it says how to start the business as a
16:31
teenager and now it puts the text so that's it so now I basically have a
16:37
pretty high chance uh to score on this keywords and of course if I want to go further I will
16:44
make a page that will have this title and full description but I usually don't
16:51
recommend making pages right away because it takes more time to make a page than to make a fake item that's why
16:58
start with this and then watch the queries in the search console and you will see whether you have any traffic
17:05
for this keyword and if you have any traffic for this keyword then go ahead and make a page for that then you'll win
17:10
more traffic so basically my whole approach with director is this you have to be doing as little as possible to
17:18
validate all the assumptions and then the assumption that wins going to take more of your time and you invest proper
17:25
human time into that and you make it really good because obviously AI is not
17:31
as good as humans but it it's it's pretty good for these experiments but then you make it Greater with your own
17:38
hands yeah so this is my article my my website and just to save time I will
17:46
switch to the website I just made because it's pretty much the same but with the
17:52
data yeah how I just made it before the the call so this is my directory the
17:59
small business ideas and uh I have all the ideas here and and my goal is to
18:05
have I know maybe 10 or 100 Sol ideas here and I looked at this keywords so I
18:14
put small little size startup so every keyword you see here has been validated
18:21
for traffic either directly or through indirect words and same for all the St in the FAQ
18:29
so every question I have here is coming from from the method I just used so
18:35
that's pretty much it and and here I have like feature business ideas so it all takes if it takes you more than one
18:43
evening then you're doing it wrong because if it takes more than one evening you need to redo your method
18:51
otherwise you're kind of riding on a small car on a on a slow car and you will never get really far with that so
18:57
you have to make sure that you're moving fast because there's a chance that everything I've done will fail there's
19:03
really high chance and maybe tomorrow or after a week I will figure out that this will not work that's why I usually bet
19:09
for five six 10 ideas and I test them all the same time so that I remove the
19:16
chance to be disappointed when one one idea fails that's that's pretty good
19:22
approach I would say like don't do Just One Directory because it will be disappointing and you have to wait quite a lot for SEO to get in and to validate
19:30
certain assumptions but if you have 10 of them then it's faster so now the next
Promoting your new directory
19:35
thing I do is once I built the directory I have to promote it somewhere
19:42
so I I do few things so the first thing I do I go to Reddit and I search I just search in
19:51
Google small bonus ideas Reddit when I do that I will see all the Reddit
19:58
articles about that and then I go into those articles and I reply with my
20:04
URL just have to be careful to not be banned and to not be banned you have to
20:10
reply on articles where people actually ask for URLs and there are articles like
20:16
that where people ask do you know places to find the ideas and then you put your
20:22
url nobody going to hate you for that and there a lot of Articles like that so for this particular thing I found over
20:29
100 articles there're not it took me time you have to search with different kind of queries and then you don't have
20:36
to just go into every article and reply right away you just make a plan to make
20:41
three replies a day or one or two just to not be blocked or banned by by the Reddit engine itself because it has some
20:49
rules for URLs too besides the subreddits so that's number one thing I do and that brings some traffic and then
20:55
the number two thing I do is I put my directory into other
21:01
directories and that's probably the second best way to start on marketing
21:09
because uh directories are big and that's why the other directories might bring traffic to your directory but it
21:15
has to be relevant so you have to find directories which are relevant but again you Google for them and usually find
21:22
them and then the third thing I do is I go to social media and I start searching
21:28
for the same question and then when I find the question there I reply with my
21:34
directory there which works sometimes really well if if your directory
21:40
actually helps to the original question I had that when fireship had this what
21:46
was that he had this viral tweet about self Hoster software on Twitter and I
21:52
replied with my hosted software directory and it was the most viewed and
21:58
like reply there and since his post was like a million views mine got like 30 or
22:04
40K views it was really good and and the interesting thing that many people don't
22:10
know is that Google they don't say so but they
22:15
do this I I know for sure they look at backlinks from social media and if there
22:22
is a good tweet with a lot of views and there is your link there it's so valuable and in that particular case it
22:30
was like fifth or or 50th time I proved that so right after that tweet was going
22:36
viral with my link there the next day I had traffic from Google growing for everything I have for all the blogs for
22:42
all the items so this is way better backlink than a backlink from websites
22:49
actually now these days so that's the third thing I do social media and I
22:55
spend some time every day uh on that like probably every morning there are
23:00
tools for that to spy for keywords but I rather do it myself
23:07
because search is pretty good on Twitter and it's it's same kind of
23:12
experience but more native and then the fourth thing I do is the SEO and that's
SEO for directory
23:19
probably the most important part and I do it after the first four steps because
23:24
first four steps help me to validate my idea because if I posted somewhere and no clicks it means that it doesn't click
23:32
with people right so people sew it but they don't click it it means it's a bad idea or the domain name is bad I have to
23:39
change something there's no reason to push it further but if I have some traffic and it looks fine then I go for
23:45
SEO because that's that's the key way of growing the directories and I will show
23:50
you what I do with SEO so I have built a tool for that too but there are a lot of ways of doing SEO and I will walk
23:56
through all of them but start with with the way I do it
24:07
myself yeah so I go here
24:17
and so I put my directory
24:23
here and basically what it does is that it scrapes my directory it it it will
24:29
now try to understand everything that's written on it it will try to do some research so it will basically do all the
24:36
actions I do usually myself and that's how we build this agent so I just took
24:42
all the actions I do and I program them into the agent and in a
24:49
minute it will come up with some ideas on what what what can I do with the with
24:55
SEO for this uh directory and while it's doing it there are other ways of doing
25:01
it so one way of doing it is to use clothing or chity and generate content
25:09
there but I would rather recommend using tools
25:15
for that because SEO is more than just a Content it's a lot about in internal
25:21
linking it's a lot about uh the structure the keyword research and all
25:26
those things so in this case it figured out the content of my page
25:31
and then it found uh the keywords and it came up
25:37
with uh with ideas so these are pretty good like 10 locost business ideas for
25:44
2025 uh and it evaluates the possible traffic it can get for that based on the
25:49
keywords and I can just go
25:55
further and here I have the done for 10 articles so don't start with alarm
26:01
articles some people just go crazy and you know publish hundreds of them if
26:07
your site is fresh and the domain rating is low if you publish a lot of Articles Google will just never coll them because
26:15
it will look like spam for Google that's why the first month you should have
26:20
maximum 50 pages or 50 articles on on your website and then second month you
26:25
can do more so I usually go for 10 artic on the first month all right I will approve this
26:35
one so now it's working on this article so it's um it's looking for the keywords
26:42
evaluating their traffic the complexity and then know working on a outline so it
26:48
does pretty good job and one way to learn SEO is to watch what saay or bot does and repeat it manually if if
26:56
someone wants to do it with their own hands because it does it pretty well it does
27:02
pretty well with all the steps and all the actions yeah so now we will create the
27:07
Articles and will publish them back to my website and quick ad break let me tell you about
27:14
a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago
27:20
I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of
27:27
the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help
27:35
you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't
27:40
want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to
27:47
rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested
27:54
in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day spring with 100% money back guarantee who does
28:01
that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com and
28:06
that's it so from that moment I quit working on this directory
28:13
completely so it all takes me usually first day to build and promote it on Reddit and social
28:21
media and then the other day for SEO and more promotion and then I just stopped doing anything with that
28:28
and I go for the next directory or I go for other idea and then I come back in
28:34
30 days and I look at the traffic and I see
28:40
whether there is traffic or no traffic and sometimes there is no traffic and the thing is that if there's no traffic
28:46
from my experience if there's no traffic it's really hard to fix that so I I
28:52
never managed to make a directory have no traffic in the month and then do
28:58
something so that it actually gets the traffic it's very difficult because if there's no traffic then something is
29:03
wrong fundamentally maybe the domain name is wrong maybe uh the keyword look
29:09
easy but in fact it is not that's why my recommendation is to
29:15
never fall in love with the idea for a directory but rather make maybe five bats and then in
29:21
30 days look at the one that does the best and then put more time into that otherwise you'll be trying to you know
29:28
push the dying horse and will just never work and in thir days uh I find the
29:36
directory that does the best among all I did and then I do the next phase and the next phase is the data and that part is
Data/Content for directory
29:45
even more important because at the beginning you just selling the idea and
29:51
people click that just to validate that they really care they have the pain but
29:58
you don't Focus that much yet on whether your directory is actually good because
30:04
if you focus on everything at once it's is difficult to be good at anything right so that's where the first 30 days
30:09
I focus only on validation of potential SEO traffic and the interest from people
30:16
but after a month I go full into the data and a lot of people who build
30:22
directories fail here like must fail here because they don't put enough
30:29
effort into making the data great and here's what happens if somebody opens
30:35
your directory and they know the topic they understand it they are probably
30:42
experts they can quickly see whether your data is high quality whe whether you understand the topic yourself and
30:49
you're not someone who just used chity to come up with the items right and if
30:55
that expert who sees your direct sees that the value of the content is
31:01
high the quality is high they really respect that and they they really want to share with their With Their
31:08
audience and that happened with all my good directories so they all have this
31:13
moment where an influencer or few shareed With Their audience because they think it's really good and they will
31:19
never think it's good if it's actually not good because they understand the data really well if they come to uh let's say I made this directory it was
31:28
um llm models and then first I had I just hired a guy to
31:35
fill it out with data and then I open it and I see that it's
31:41
missing mistell there's no mistal there and this this is the example where if an
31:47
expert comes in and they see you don't have mistell in your directory they will quickly realize that
31:54
you don't know the topic you would never miss the most important open source
32:00
project back at the time right and so if
32:06
if the data is great uh the influencers might share it with their audience and
32:11
from there your job pretty much ends because
32:16
now it just turns into the organic system that people share if somebody
32:21
shared then other people also want to share it like people work in a collective mind right and the only thing
32:28
you have to do from there is to make sure the data is great you keep running your
32:33
SEO activities like I run the agent and others can do other things but then the
32:40
key focus is making sure that you check the data you check the space
32:47
every week or month and you make sure that if there is really hot item appearing like new item that everybody
32:54
talks about on Twitter you have to add it there you have to add into to your directory and you have to do it fast
33:00
because if you do it fast there's a chance you will actually get the traffic from Google from people who search for
33:06
that new hot item right on your directory and that's why say there
33:11
there's very little work to do but you have to have put attention into the space almost every day so I have a lot
33:19
of directories I don't really do stuff but I scroll Twitter every day and once
33:25
I see that oh this item is relevant for this directory I just bring it in and
33:31
that's kind of the next way the next wave of growth comes from being early to
33:36
list hot items on your directory and Google will find nothing else on
33:42
internet to supply to the user who is searching for that and Google will will show your item your page for that yeah
33:49
okay so that's that's the whole path well it's the whole path so what
33:55
you've just first of all that's thank you for for going through that but what you've just explained is how to come up
34:00
with an idea for a directory how to create content for the directory how to
34:06
build the website for the directory how to uh how to grow the directory and how to iterate with the directory one of my
How to monetize directory
34:13
questions is great now I'm getting 50,000 unique visitors a month on this directory how are people monetizing
34:21
directories uh and what what have you learned around the best ways to monetize directories if there is a best way
34:28
yeah yeah so there are multiple ways depending on your audience so if your
34:34
directory is B2B it's easier to monetize it because obviously uh you can go to
34:41
businesses who have the same audience as your directory and you can pitch them in
34:47
the banner spot or the sponsor options that's what I always did I had
34:52
directories of all gpts and I just sent an email to all GPT owners saying that
34:58
do you guys want to be featured on top of this directory because we have 30k items you just one of 30k do you want to
35:04
be the number one on the top and then a lot of people said yes so that's one way
35:11
the other way is the affiliate links and that way works pretty
35:17
good if the items you have on your directory cost a lot so if you have
35:23
items costing $10 then you'll make a little money on that because you need a lot of clicks but if you have items for
35:30
500 or few k then there is good money to be made there for example I have a directory for next GS boiler plates and
35:38
I have affiliate links to all the boiler plates and they all cost quite a lot and
35:45
it brings quite a good money good income so I would not exclude one way or the
35:51
other I would say do the first one do the second one like do the sponsoring do the affiliate links and then the third
35:59
option is uh is to sell the data be careful to
36:05
not sell the data as a is because obviously you can't sell people private data but you can
36:11
sell the the anonymized data or you can sell the
36:16
insights and that's possibly bringing good income if
36:24
you find somebody who needs that and usually you have to sell it to the corporates and you have to pitch that to
36:30
the bigger companies where they are interested in in in the percentage in the distributions and things like that
36:38
and the the most obvious way to monetize directory is to have a pay wall to list
36:45
for example in this case um it's probably harder for business ideas
36:50
because why would someone pay to list their business idea but for example if
36:55
you're making list of n n like search for nanes and then every Nanny would pay
37:02
quite good amount to be listed there if you have traffic and if you have the buyers and the same the buyers so that's
37:09
number four payable for listings charge 500 or $50 for listings and then the
37:16
number five is charge for Access for those who are most interested in the
37:22
case of directory of nannies if you are interested in hiring a nanny you would
37:28
probably pay good amount to get access to the whole database so you show top five or
37:34
you show nanis without their contact data without their photos and then to
37:40
unlock that contact data you have to pay and then you get access to the whole directory either you you get access for
37:46
life or you get access for a month and then you can charge them for for that every
37:52
month and the sixth is you find
37:58
uh the brand sponsors that's what I do now uh so once your directories are pretty big you can find big companies
38:05
big corporates who don't need the traffic who just need the brand promotion like we have Dev hun for
38:12
example and it's really big it's the biggest after produ hunt and and now it's very easy to get big Brands like
38:22
Clerk or like super base and others to want to be there to be affiliated with
38:28
it because that's where developers hang out and they're willing to pay just to be affiliated with the
38:36
product like so that you write like it's sponsored by super base and it's not for the clicks it's it's for their brand
38:42
there and they're willing to pay for that every month or every week so we have very good deals now with with a lot
38:49
of the players like that for ongoing sponsorship and and that's the best one
38:54
because a it's ongoing usually they will pay forever because your traffic just
38:59
keeps growing it just gets better for them and and also it doesn't destroy
39:06
your directory because the Banners are slightly annoying for users because they
39:11
will be shown and you want people to click on them so you will you will make them different color and that annoys
39:17
some people but the sponsor links are usually smaller and they don't annoy people that much so those are the six
39:25
ways and then the last way is or there two more but they are available
39:31
for those who have other projects so if you have SAS project like I do and the
39:37
main reason I started with directories was that I realized one really interesting thing it
39:45
is much harder to win SEO traffic for a SAS tool than for a directory so instead
39:52
of trying to win SE traffic directly for my SAS tool which has
39:58
some random brand name that has nothing to do with the keyword that's why it's hard and I rather make
40:05
director following the SEO driven approach I win traffic on directories
40:10
and they channel the traffic from directories into the SAS
40:16
tools and that turned out to be the best idea I ever had in marketing because now
40:25
almost all my traffic goes not to my products but to directories and then to
40:31
the products and also directories are competing for the keywords that nobody
40:37
want to pay for for SAS you compete with VCB companies who are paying a lot for
40:43
the keywords but nobody wants to pay for directory keywords because there's no money there and there no VCB directory
40:50
that that wants to compete with you so that's the good way to monetize
40:56
directory indirectly basically it's your free traffic which you would otherwise
41:02
pay for and and the the last one is you can sell directories and you can sell
41:08
them exactly to the people who have SAS tools who have the same audience as your
41:15
directory and they would buy it just to channel the traffic and I did that I sold
41:21
all I sold all gbts do go to cheap. a
41:27
and they bought it because it has exactly the same audience and and it was really useful for them I
41:36
think there's probably the best Airy on the market right now for marketing for a
41:41
SAS company is to buy a directory and channeled the traffic it is way better
41:46
than newsletter ads or all other ways because directors are pretty cheap if you look at their traffic let's say
41:53
there's a directory with 100K views a month and you can buy it and in a year
41:59
you get a million views and in that million views you can Channel at least
42:04
3% so it's like 30k 30k clicks a year
42:10
and you will pay for the directory maybe 20K and if you pay 20K so it's less than a dollar per click less than a dollar
How much can you sell a directory for
42:17
what are the multiples for directories approximately like what are people paying for a
42:25
directory there's no system at all it just depends on the audience because you
42:30
you can't have multiples based on Revenue because re revenue is usually not that important the traffic itself
42:35
also like some traffic is more expensive than the others I think from what I seen the actual Deals
42:44
they go from 2K they start at 2K so you can find and buy a director for 2K which
42:51
is which has traffic so it will definitely pay the the investment back
42:57
and then the average directories go for 20K in average so small ones go for 2 to
43:03
5K and then 15 to 20K the average ones and then the bigger ones go to
43:09
100K and I think that's where it stops I never seen a directory being sold for
43:14
over 100k and where where are people finding like if you if someone wants to
43:20
go and buy a directory do is there a Marketplace that people can go to or um
43:26
is this like reaching out to to Founders who who are selling directories well I just bought the
43:32
domain called sell directories.com yesterday so I will launch the the
43:38
marketplace that's hilarious right now I see them mostly on small marketplaces
43:45
like not the ac.com because aire.com doesn't let directors in because they don't have revenue and they require
43:52
their revenue but then there are these smaller marketplaces for smaller rep sites and I see directories there often
43:59
for example one I seen the directories the most on called Micron iio I think
44:06
it's a small one and they had like 10 directories under 10k there some sold
44:14
some still being sold so but I think the best way to actually buy
44:19
director is to go to similar web
44:25
and research the traffic research the audience research the
44:31
countries and then reach out to them and offer to buy I I do
44:38
that and because if somebody put their directory for sale very often they want
44:44
to sell it for quite a lot but if you surprise a Founder with a offer for a
44:50
directory they might just sell it right away for the offer you made and you can have a better deal I think that's what I
44:58
do right now last question and I know you don't brag or really share
45:05
mrr that that much but as much as you're willing to share if someone you know
How large can a directory became
45:11
what I like about directories is you can do it yourself or even a like micro or tiny team um what sort of scale could
45:20
some of these businesses get to how big could some of these directories get to if someone to
45:27
start one of these I think the the 5K is
45:33
is probably where you can get without being lucky or being too smart like in
45:39
in my case I would say the average directory I have is there it's on
45:46
5K uh and I know that if I put more time I can bring it to maybe 15 to 20K I
45:53
think 20K is probably the limit for the the right now on the market unless you
46:00
want to go fulltime into that and that's your main project but I don't see director as main projects so I only see
46:06
them as side projects and I think as a side project where you have either I have my main projects but other people
46:12
have main jobs for for that kind of case I think people can expect 5K Mr on that
46:19
and then uh eventually get to the 10K but I wouldn't hope for a lot more than
46:25
that so I would look at directories as a as a way to fund your life if you don't
46:30
live in us because that's good money outside of us or I think directories are
46:37
really good way to start building soft not software but digital products
46:42
because starting with SAS is is the is the worst idea because you
46:48
will fail Almost 100% And then you'll
46:53
probably feel bad about that and never start again and go back to a job but with directories it's really hard to
47:00
fail I don't think anyone can fail if they launch enough directories and if
47:05
they spend you know six months on on those directories because in SAS failure
47:12
means that you don't have growing revenues but in directories if you get to stable 5K visits a month for a B2B
47:20
directory you will sell four or five ads and you will make three 4K a month on that and and that it will stay that way
47:28
and even if you do nothing it will just grow because you have SEO as your channel and SEO tends to grow even if
47:35
you do nothing if it's a directory because directories are in non-competitive keywords so that's why
47:43
my recommendation start with a directory as your first attempt to build interet
47:52
business and you will have more fun because you will get
47:59
the doamin faster so B traffic and maybe the first sponsor all those things it
48:05
will get faster compared to SAS and then you decide either you go full I see I I
48:11
know people who go with directories uh full in for example starter story is a
48:17
directory too right it's a directory of starter stories and he's making our a million and uh prod hunt was the
48:25
directory of ideas first there was no voting system at all it was just a list
48:30
of products he would just look around the internet and put in and send into newsletter every day right so there's a
48:39
way to grow into millions but also the risk of failing
48:44
completely is pretty low too yep well I think that's a beautiful
48:50
place to end um John where where could people find
48:57
find out more about you and get to know you better on the internet Twitter is the best place is
49:03
John Rush X or my website John rush. me
49:09
and I have this directory guide I I launched where where I walk through all
49:14
these steps of Ting building growing selling monetizing so that's probably
49:19
something people should look it into if they want to learn the directory World
49:26
beautiful beautiful well man this has been a this has been a gift you gave people a gift I think directories are criminally
49:34
underrated and uh I appreciate you coming back on uh the show if people liked it you gotta like it on YouTube I
49:42
guess right and you gotta you know comment and and and build John up you
49:48

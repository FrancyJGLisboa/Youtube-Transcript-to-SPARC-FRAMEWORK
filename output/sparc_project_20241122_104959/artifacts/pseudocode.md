# Stock Price Prediction System Pseudocode

## 1. Core Components

### Main classes/modules

```python
class StockData:
    # This class handles fetching and processing of stock data

class MonteCarloSimulation:
    # This class handles the Monte Carlo simulations

class TradingSimulation:
    # This class handles the trading simulations

class ReportGenerator:
    # This class handles the generation of performance reports
```

### Key functions

```python
def fetch_stock_data(symbol):
    # This function fetches stock data from the Yahoo Finance API

def process_stock_data(data):
    # This function processes the fetched stock data for simulations

def perform_monte_carlo_simulation(data):
    # This function performs the Monte Carlo simulation on the processed data

def predict_next_day_price(simulation_results):
    # This function predicts the next day's stock price based on the simulation results

def simulate_trading(simulation_results, play_money):
    # This function simulates trading based on the simulation results and play money

def generate_performance_report(trading_results):
    # This function generates a performance report based on the trading results
```

### Data structures

```python
# The stock data is stored in a DataFrame with columns for date, open, high, low, close, and volume

# The simulation results are stored in a DataFrame with columns for simulation number and predicted price

# The trading results are stored in a DataFrame with columns for trade number, trade action, trade price, and trade result
```

### Interfaces

```python
# The system interfaces with the Yahoo Finance API to fetch stock data
```

## 2. Flow Control

### Main process flows

```python
# The main process flow of the system is as follows:

# 1. Fetch stock data
# 2. Process stock data
# 3. Perform Monte Carlo simulation
# 4. Predict next day's stock price
# 5. Simulate trading
# 6. Generate performance report
```

### Error handling

```python
# The system should handle errors during data fetching, processing, simulations, and report generation

# If an error occurs, the system should log the error and notify the user
```

### Data validation

```python
# The system should validate the fetched stock data to ensure it is in the correct format and contains no missing values
```

### State management

```python
# The system should manage the state of the simulations and trading to ensure accurate results and reports
```

## 3. Integration Points

### External system interfaces

```python
# The system interfaces with the Yahoo Finance API to fetch stock data
```

### API definitions

```python
# The Yahoo Finance API is used to fetch stock data
```

### Data transformations

```python
# The fetched stock data is transformed into a format suitable for simulations
```

### Authentication flows

```python
# The system may need to authenticate with the Yahoo Finance API to fetch stock data
```
